Here are some resources to give you some insight into your Wikibase instance and to help keep it healthy and up to date.

### Architecture overview

First it's important to understand what you've got on your hands. Take a look at our [Docker architecture overview](https://github.com/wmde/wikibase-docker#wikibase-docker). 

And here's an architecture table with a diagram (click to enlarge):

<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>

<table style="width: auto;" border="1">

<tr style="background-color:#D3D3D3;color:#ffffff;">
<td><b>Service name</b></td>

<tr>
<td><b>wikibase</b></td>
<td><a href="http://localhost:8181">localhost:8181</a></td>
<td>MediaWiki with the Wikibase extension</td>

<tr>

### Docker tooling

The best tool for managing your Docker install is the one you used to get it going in the first place: **docker-compose**. This manual can't possibly replace a grounding in Docker, so check out Docker's own command references for [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/reference/) and the [docker engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/docker/).

That said, here are some starter commands that might come in handy. 

**Note**: Container names created using `docker-compose` begin with the basename of the directory in which they were created with the first `docker-compose up` invocation, separated by an underscore. The example container names below begin with `wbdocker_` because, for example purposes, we created them with the `docker-compose.yml` file sitting in a directory named `wbdocker`.

#### Get a command shell on a container

You won't need it for typical Wikibase activity, but for Docker beginners here's one very useful command that connects to a running container:

```
docker exec -it <container name> bash
```

#### Copy a file to your local directory 
```
docker cp wbdocker_wikibase_1:/var/www/html/LocalSettings.php LocalSettings.php
```

This also works in the other direction, and the combination is useful for, say, grabbing your LocalSettings.php, editing it and putting it right back.

```
docker cp LocalSettings.php wbdocker_wikibase_1:/var/www/html/LocalSettings.php 
```

Read [Adam Shorland's excellent blog post](https://addshore.com/2018/06/customizing-wikibase-config-in-the-docker-compose-example/) for more detail on modifying files on containers.

#### Stop the Docker containers

This command stops the Docker containers, leaving the machines (and of course all data) intact:

`docker-compose stop`

As you might imagine, you can use `docker-compose start` to start them again.

#### Delete the containers while preserving data

This command removes the containers but preserves all data in MySQL, MediaWiki and the query service in Docker volumes.

`docker-compose down`

#### Delete everything

**WARNING**: this will remove ALL of the data you ever added to your Docker install, which includes MediaWiki, Wikibase, ElasticSearch and the MySQL database. There's no coming back from this!

`docker-compose down --volumes`


### Logs

Each application in the Wikibase cluster has its own log output. Consult each service's own documentation to learn how to read its logs.

In the directory where you placed your `docker-compose.yml` file, run the `docker-compose logs` command and the name of the service (check the table above) to see its logs. For example:
```
user@host:~/docker$ docker-compose logs mysql --tail 100
mysql_1 | 2019-12-31 10:00:00+00:00 [Note] [Entrypoint]: Entrypoint script for MySQL Server started.
mysql_1 | 2019-12-31 10:00:00+00:00 [Note] [Entrypoint]: Switching to dedicated user 'mysql'
...
```

### Backup and restore

The data in your Wikibase instance is valuable. Regular backups and tested restores of data are vital.

Generally, there are two bodies of data you'll need to back up: the MediaWiki/Wikibase filesystem and, more importantly, the MySQL database.

First and foremost, we recommend reading the [Wikibase Docker README](https://github.com/wmde/wikibase-docker/blob/master/README-compose.md) to get the lay of the land.

#### Docker level

Since this is a Docker install, backup using Docker tools is recommended.

Docker-level backup is explained in some detail in [this section of the wikibase-docker README](https://github.com/wmde/wikibase-docker/blob/master/README-compose.md#backing-up-data-from-docker-volumes). It involves backing up the Docker [volumes](https://docs.docker.com/storage/volumes/) and dumping out the database with [mysqldump](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/making-backups-with-mysqldump/).

For a helpful overview of Docker data backup and restore, including the use of the `docker save` and `docker load` commands, read this excellent [StackOverflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26331651/how-can-i-backup-a-docker-container-with-its-data-volumes#26339848). It's been updated several times since its original posting in 2014 and constitutes a great tour and jumping-off point for the docker command-line reference linked above.

#### On-container level

Backup on the container level is not an easy proposition; we cover it here mainly to present a more complete picture of MediaWiki and Wikibase under the hood.

To that end, read the documentation on [backing up a MediaWiki](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Manual:Backing_up_a_wiki), bearing in mind that the work needs to be done from within the containers (cf. [Docker tooling]({{site.url}}/maint#docker-tooling) above) and the data extracted and placed somewhere safe outside of Docker.


### Wiki tools

Wikibase is an extension of MediaWiki. Much of the functionality you'll be working with is actually that of MediaWiki, so consult the [MediaWiki technical manual](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Manual:Contents) and the [administrator's hub](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Sysadmin_hub). Of particular note:

* [User guide](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Help:Contents)
* [User rights management](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Manual:User_rights)
* [Wiki admin guide](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Manual:Administrators)


### Updating

Keeping software up to date is the only way to obtain new features, not to mention how important it is to apply bug and security fixes. 

Updating Wikibase on Docker involves upgrading MediaWiki itself (see the [MediaWiki update documentation](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Manual:Update.php)) as well as tweaking the [docker-compose.yml](https://github.com/wmde/wikibase-docker/blob/master/docker-compose.yml) file itself.

We recommend reading Adam Shorland's [blog post](https://addshore.com/2019/01/wikibase-docker-mediawiki-wikibase-update/) for a step-by-step guide to updating your Wikibase.
