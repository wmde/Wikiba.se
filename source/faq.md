### What is the difference between Wikibase and Wikidata?

Wikibase is the software that powers the [Wikidata project](https://www.wikidata.org/), for which Wikibase was originally written. 

Wikidata is a free knowledge base that anyone can edit. The information in Wikidata is used by Wikipedia, its various sister projects and anyone else who has need for or interest in a large amount of open general-purpose data.

### Where can I find the source code?

Wikibase consists of several components. You can find an overview on the [resources page]({{site.url}}/resources).

### How can I easily set up my own Wikibase instance?

You can use our [Docker quick start]({{site.url}}/docker) or take a look at our Docker containers aover at [docker hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/wikibase/).
